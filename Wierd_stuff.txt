1. Error in building C code.

If there are includes that can't be resolved, this can be caused by
indexes that are out of date.  Changing Qsys and regenerating the BSP
(and hence system.h) causes the problem where the source code is correct
but the includes in system.h can't be resolved.

To fix this, select the project and right-click --> Index --> Rebuild.
Also may need to --> ReResolve Unresolved Includes.
The do a Project --> Clean

----------------------------------------------

2. The Board Support Package (settings.bsp) has hard-coded paths. Lines 7
and 8 must be edited to point to the directory where the bsp file is located.

<BspGeneratedLocation>/home/tom/TSDR-Dev/devkit_simple_socket_server-17_project/software/MOD_socket_server_bsp</BspGeneratedLocation>
<BspSettingsFile>/home/tom/TSDR-Dev/devkit_simple_socket_server-17_project/software/MOD_socket_server_bsp/settings.bsp</BspSettingsFile>

Otherwise it will attempt to overwrite the wrong directory when the
BSP is regenerated (anytime the Qsys peripherals change).

3. Because the BSP is edited, the software build will now fail due to the timestamp
on the BSP file being newer than the software build. The makefile error prints
on-console text instructions that DO NOT WORK.  Instead you must:

  A. Open the BSP settings editor.
  B. Use that BSP Editor File --> Open.
  C. Navigate extensively through the file system to the <your-project-location>/
  software/MOD_socket_server_bsp/settings.bsp file, then open.
  D. Generate the new Board Support Package.
  E. This over-writes any changes/patches made to the drivers.
  F One change is needed in the
  <your-project-location>/MOD_socket_server_bsp/drivers/src/altera-avalon-tse.c
  file (this is the ethernet driver).
  F. Change the value in line 1610 from sleep(1000)   to   sleep(2000)
